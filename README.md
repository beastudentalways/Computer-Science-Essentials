# Design Patterns

* [Decorator Design Pattern](https://www.baeldung.com/java-decorator-pattern)

# SOLID Design Principles
1. Single Responsibilty Principle
 * There should not be GOD class which does all the work.
 * There should not be too many classes with one function each, use common sense to design classes else a single class will have too many dependencies. 
2. Open Closed Principle
 [Example1](https://www.baeldung.com/java-open-closed-principle)   
 [Example2](https://springframework.guru/principles-of-object-oriented-design/open-closed-principle/)    
 
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
   [Example](https://reflectoring.io/lsp-explained/)

4. Interface Segregation Principle
   [Example](https://reflectoring.io/interface-segregation-principle/)
   
5. Dependency Inversion
   [Example](https://springframework.guru/principles-of-object-oriented-design/dependency-inversion-principle/)
